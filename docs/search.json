Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/alexm/Downloads/Pract 2/AlexMartinez-P2-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

We see that the overall model is significant with a p-value &lt; 0.05 and that 79% of the variation in the model can be explained by the predictor variables. We see that age is not significant at predicting spend_score but income and genderMale are significant and predicting spend_score.\nThe second model is a logistic model where we are predicting the binary buy variable with spend_score, income, age and genderMale as the independent variables. Each statistic represents the log odds of the variable so:\nSpend Score Coefficient: The change in the log-odds of making a purchase for each one-unit increase in spend_score, holding other variables constant. Income Coefficient: The change in the log-odds of making a purchase for each one-unit increase in income, holding other variables constant. Age Coefficient: The change in the log-odds of making a purchase for each one-year increase in age, holding other variables constant. Gender Coefficient: The difference in the log-odds of making a purchase between Male and the reference gender (Female in this case), holding other variables constant."

Run str and summary on the new object you created. You should now have 2907 observations, down from 10545. Depending on how you do this, you might also notice that all the different categories are still kept in the continent (and other) variables, but show 0. R does not automatically remove categories of what in R is called a factor variable (a categorical variable) even if they are empty. We don’t have to worry about that just now, but something to keep in mind, it can sometimes lead to strange behavior.\n\nafricadata &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(continent == 'Africa') #filters for Africa continent only\nstr(africadata) # variable description\n\n'data.frame':   2907 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  148 208 187 116 161 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  47.5 36 38.3 50.3 35.2 ...\n $ fertility       : num  7.65 7.32 6.28 6.62 6.29 6.95 5.65 6.89 5.84 6.25 ...\n $ population      : num  11124892 5270844 2431620 524029 4829291 ...\n $ gdp             : num  1.38e+10 NA 6.22e+08 1.24e+08 5.97e+08 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(africadata) #variables summary statistics\n\n         country          year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     :  57   Min.   :1960   Min.   : 11.40   Min.   :13.20  \n Angola      :  57   1st Qu.:1974   1st Qu.: 62.20   1st Qu.:48.23  \n Benin       :  57   Median :1988   Median : 93.40   Median :53.98  \n Botswana    :  57   Mean   :1988   Mean   : 95.12   Mean   :54.38  \n Burkina Faso:  57   3rd Qu.:2002   3rd Qu.:124.70   3rd Qu.:60.10  \n Burundi     :  57   Max.   :2016   Max.   :237.40   Max.   :77.60  \n (Other)     :2565                  NA's   :226                     \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent   \n Min.   :1.500   Min.   :    41538   Min.   :4.659e+07   Africa  :2907  \n 1st Qu.:5.160   1st Qu.:  1605232   1st Qu.:8.373e+08   Americas:   0  \n Median :6.160   Median :  5570982   Median :2.448e+09   Asia    :   0  \n Mean   :5.851   Mean   : 12235961   Mean   :9.346e+09   Europe  :   0  \n 3rd Qu.:6.860   3rd Qu.: 13888152   3rd Qu.:6.552e+09   Oceania :   0  \n Max.   :8.450   Max.   :182201962   Max.   :1.935e+11                  \n NA's   :51      NA's   :51          NA's   :637                        \n                       region   \n Eastern Africa           :912  \n Western Africa           :912  \n Middle Africa            :456  \n Northern Africa          :342  \n Southern Africa          :285  \n Australia and New Zealand:  0  \n (Other)                  :  0  \n\n\nTake the africadata object and create two new objects (name them whatever you want), one that contains only infant_mortality and life_expectancy and one that contains only population and life_expectancy.

This looks like it is each year that is in Africa and it shows its trend for each streak.\nI’m sure you realized that the pattern we see in the data is due to the fact that we have different years for individual countries, and that over time these countries increase in population size and also life expectancy. Let’s pick only one year and see what patterns we find. We want a year for which we have the most data. You might have noticed that in africadata, there are 226 NA (i.e., missing values) for infant mortality. Write code that figures out which years have missing data for infant mortality. You should find that there is missing up to 1981 and then again for 2016. So we’ll avoid those years and go with 2000 instead. Create a new object by extracting only the data for the year 2000 from the africadata object. You should end up with 51 observations and 9 variables. Check it with str and summary.\n\na2000 &lt;- africadata %&gt;% filter(year == 2000) #only year 2000\nstr(a2000) # variable description\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(a2000) #variables summary statistics\n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0  \n\n\nLet’s make the same plots as above again, this time only for the year 2000.

Then repeat, now with the population size as the predictor variable. (Use the data from 2000 only.) Save the result from the two fits into two objects (e.g. fit1 and fit2) and apply the summary command to both, which will print various fit results to the screen.

The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the results folder.\nIt’s the same code done 3 times:\n\nFirst, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.\nSecond, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.\nThird, my current favorite, is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.\n\nThe last version has the advantage of having code in one place for easy writing/debugging, and then being able to pull the code into the Quarto file for a nice combination of text/commentary and code.\nEach way of doing this is a reasonable approach, pick whichever one you prefer or makes the most sense for your setup. Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

(This is often called a Codebook.) For this simple example, the codebook is given as a second sheet in the Excel file.\nThis raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code."

Since those files might be used by several of the products, I’m placing them in the main products folder. Feel free to re-organize."
